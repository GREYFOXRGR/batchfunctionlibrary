      <p class="title"><span class="title">Batch Functions Explained</span></p>
      <p class="heading"><span class="heading">Passing Arguments</span></p>
      <p>Most high-level programming languages allow arguments to be passed to
        functions 'by value' and 'by reference'. Passing by value means that
        the function receives a copy of the arguments value. Any changes made
         to this copy by the function do no affect the original variable.</p>
      <p> When a variable is passed by reference, the function
        receives a pointer to the original variable, and loosely speaking, changes
        made to this pointer by the function do affect the original variable.</p>
      <p>In the batch programming language  variables
        are  passed by reference. Unfortunately the pointers to the original
        variables are read only and consequently cannot be assigned values and
        therefore are unable to alter the variable which they point to.</p>
      <p> The good news is that with a
          little ingenuity, the batch language can be coerced into passing variables
          by value and by reference in a similar way to high-level languages
        such as C and Visual Basic.</p>
      <p class="heading">By Value </p>
      <p>Below is a very simple example  showing how to
        pass an argument by value and how that value is then read by  the function. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="function">1. @echo off &amp; setlocal ENABLEEXTENSIONS <br>
          2. set str=Hello<br>
          3. call :demoA %str%<br>
          4. goto :EOF<br>
          5.<br>
          6. :demoA<br>
          7. echo/%1<br>
        8. goto :EOF</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In line 3, <span class="function">%str%</span> is expanded to <span class="function">Hello</span>,
        and then the memory location of where  <span class="function">Hello</span> is
        actually stored is assigned  to <span class="function">%1</span>. Line
        7 then references <span class="function">%1</span> which is then expanded
        to <span class="function">Hello</span>.</p>
      <p> If two or more arguments were being passed, they
          could be referenced using <span class="function">%2</span>, <span class="function">%3</span> and
          so on, all the way up to <span class="function">%9</span>. If more
          than nine variables were being passed, then to reference the tenth,
          the <span class="function">shift</span> command
          would have to be used.</p>
      <p> <span class="function">shift</span> effectively
          increments all the pointers. Before
          <span class="function">shift</span> is used, <span class="function">%0</span> points
          to the name of the function or routine and <span class="function">%1</span> points
          to the first argument. After <span class="function">shift</span> is
          used, <span class="function">%0</span> points to what <span class="function">%1</span> used
          to point to, <span class="function">%1</span> points
          to what <span class="function">%2</span> used to point to and so on.
          The tenth argument can now be referenced using <span class="function">%9</span>.</p>
      <p class="heading">By Reference</p>
      <p>Here is a slighty different version of the example above. Instead
        of passing the value <span class="function">Hello</span> to the function,
        the name of a variable that contains <span class="function">Hello</span> is
        passed instead.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="function">1. @echo off &amp; setlocal ENABLEEXTENSIONS <br>
    2. set str=Hello<br>
    3. call :demoB str<br>
    4. goto :EOF<br>
    5.<br>
    6. :demoB<br>
    7. call echo/%%%1%%<br>
    8. goto :EOF</p>
      </blockquote>      
      <p>Inside the function <span class="function">demoB</span>, <span class="function">%1</span> expands
        to <span class="function">str</span>. To read the value contained in <span class="function">str</span>,
        it is necessary to enclose
        <span class="function">%1</span> with double percents and instruct the
        command interpreter to perform another expansion. This is most easily
        accomplished by using the <span class="function">CALL</span> command
        as shown in line 7. For a detailed explanation of variable expansion,
        see the thread in alt.msdos.batch.nt titled &quot;<a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF8&amp;threadm=01c192d1%241ba56990%240125250a%40aiyvzvwkvtdqrqbf&amp;rnum=1&amp;prev=/groups%3Fhl%3Den%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF8%26q%3D%2522variable%2Bexpansion%2B(w2ksp2)%2522%26sa%3DN%26tab%3Dwg%26meta%3D" target="_blank">Variable
        expansion (W2KSP2)</a>&quot;.</p>
      <p>Why would we want to pass arguments like this? Well now
          that the function knows the name of a variable, it can assign
        it a value  and thereby the function can now return values.</p>
      <p class="heading">Returning Values</p>      
      <p>So far the contrived examples have only served to illustrate
        the points being made. This next example demonstrates  how a function
        can return a value and is typical of the functions in this library. The
        methods used guarantee this function can be inserted, as it stands, into
        any batch file without causing any side effects whatsoever.</p>
      <p>The function  below is called <span class="function">Area</span> and
        it simply calculates the product of width and height and then returns
        the result. Three arguments are required, the first two should be passed
        by value, the third by reference.</p>
      <p class="style1">[It is a convention of this library to
          document a function's arguments by including an argument
        list immediately after the function name (as shown below on
        line 08). This is a convenient location as anything after the function
        name is ignored by the command interpreter. This list serves no other
        purpose than to act as a reminder of the type and number of arguments
        a function expects.]</p>      
      <blockquote>
        <p class="function">01.&nbsp;@echo off &amp; setlocal ENABLEEXTENSIONS<br>
          02.&nbsp;set x=2<br>
          03.&nbsp;set y=3<br>
          04.&nbsp;call :Area %x% %y% answer<br>
          05.&nbsp;echo/The area is: %answer%<br>
          06.&nbsp;goto :EOF<br>
          07.&nbsp;<br>
          08.&nbsp;:Area %width% %height% result<br>
          09.&nbsp;setlocal<br>
          10.&nbsp;set /a res=%1*%2<br>
          11.&nbsp;endlocal &amp; set &quot;%3=%res%&quot;<br>
          12.  goto :EOF</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Line 04 calls the <span class="function">Area</span> function passing
        three arguments (it could equally have read <span class="function">call&nbsp;:Area&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;</span><span class="function">answer</span>).
        The first command of the function (line 09) is <span class="function">setlocal</span>.
        This command creates a copy of the current environment and this copy
        then <em>becomes</em> the
          current environment. Line 10 calculates the product of arguments <span class="function">%1</span> and <span class="function">%2</span> and
          saves the result in the variable called <span class="function">res</span>.</p>
      <p>The next line consists of two commands seperated by an ampersand (<span class="function">&amp;</span>).
      This causes the command interpreter to expand  both commands and then
        execute them one after the other. So line 11, after it has been expanded
        equates to <span class="function">endlocal&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;&quot;answer=6&quot;</span>.
        Now the <span class="function">endlocal</span> command is executed, which
        deletes the copy of the environment created by the most recent <span class="function">setlocal</span> command,
        and restores the previous environent. Then <span class="function">set&nbsp;&quot;answer=6&quot;</span> is
        executed, and finally on line 12 <span class="function">goto&nbsp;:EOF</span> exits
        the function and execution continues at line 05. The net result is that
        the <span class="function">Area</span> function has returned a value. </p>
      <p> If on line 11, the command
         <span class="function">set&nbsp;&quot;%3=%res%&quot;</span>, had been
         expanded <em>after</em> <span class="function">endlocal</span> had been
         executed, then instead of expanding to <span class="function">set&nbsp;&quot;answer=6&quot;</span> it
        probably would have been <span class="function">set&nbsp;&quot;answer=&quot;</span> as the
        <span class="function">res</span> variable was deleted by the <span class="function">endlocal</span>        command.</p>
      <p class="heading">By Value or Reference</p>
      <p>The rule of thumb is to pass arguments by
        value unless you need to modify the original values, in which case pass
        by reference. The <span class="function">Area</span> function above demonstrates
        this rule as the first and second arguments (width and height) are passed
        by value, but in order to assign the result of the calculation to the
        <span class="function">answer</span> variable, it was passed to the function
        by reference.</p>
      <p>Sometimes it's necessary to pass arguments by reference even though
        read-only access is required. For example, when passing two or more unquoted
        arguments where at least one of them contains whitespace, the function
        would not be able to determine which argument was which if they had been
        passed by value. Calling by reference can also be used to pass arguments
        containing so-called 'poison' characters (such as &quot; ! | &lt; &gt; ^ &quot; &amp; %).</p>      <p class="heading">Protecting
          out of Scope Variables</p>
      <p> In order to create truely reusable functions, you must ensure that
        they do not unintentionally modify variables outside of their own scope.
        This is accomplished by enclosing your function's main routine with the
        <span class="function">setlocal</span> and <span class="function">endlocal</span> statements as shown in the example above.</p>      
      <p>Unfortunately things get a little more complicated when two or more
        arguments are passed by reference <em>and</em> those arguments need to
        be read by your function (as opposed to just being assigned values).
        This is best illustrated by the <span class="function">Swap</span> function
        shown below. </p>
      <p class="heading">Protecting Arguments</p>      
      <p> When passing two or more arguments by reference where those arguments
        need to be read, care must
        be taken not to destroy any of the arguments before they have <em>all</em> been
        read. Consider this example below. </p>      <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="function">01. @echo off &amp; setlocal ENABLEEXTENSIONS<br>
            02. set a=one<br>
            03. set b=two<br>
            04. echo/Before call&nbsp;&nbsp;:swap a b [%a% %b%]<br>
            05. call :Swap a b<br>
            06. echo/After call 1 :swap a b [%a% %b%]<br>
            07. call :Swap b a<br>
            08. echo/After call 2 :swap b a [%a% %b%]<br>
            09.<br>
            10. goto :EOF<br>
            11.<br>
            12. :Swap<br>
            13. setlocal<br>
            14. call set a=%%%1%%<br>
            15. call set b=%%%2%%<br>
            16. endlocal &amp; set &quot;%1=%b%&quot; &amp; set &quot;%2=%a%&quot; &amp; goto
            :EOF</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      <p>The above example displays:-</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="function">Before call&nbsp;&nbsp;:swap a b [one two]<br>
          After call 1 :swap a b [two one]<br>
          After call 2 :swap b a [one one]</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This function is supposed to swap the contents of two variables. Notice
        it succeed the first time, but failed on the second. This was caused
        by variable names outside of the function clashing with duplicate names
        inside the function. Specifically, this is what went wrong:-</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Line 07 called <span class="function">Swap</span>, the first argument
              is <span class="function">b</span>, the second <span class="function">a</span>.</li>
        <li>Line 14 is  expanded twice because of the <span class="function">call</span> command,
              after the second expansion, the line equates to <span class="function">set&nbsp;a=one</span>,
              and once this command is executed, <span class="function">a</span> is
              overwritten.</li>
        <li>Line 15 is also expanded twice and equates
            to <span class="function">set&nbsp;b=one</span>, in other
          words both <span class="function">a</span> and <span class="function">b</span> are
                    now the <span class="function">one</span> </li>
      </ul>      <p>The usual workaround for this problem is to use variable names that are 
        unique to your function by preceeding all function variables with the 
        function name separated by a period. However, if using that approach, 
        it's actually only necessary to use unique names for vulnerable variables. 
        Rewriting lines 14-16 of the Area function as shown below would prevent 
        any arguments being overwritten before they had been saved.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="batch">14. call set Swap.a=%%%1%%<br>
          15. call set b=%%%2%%<br>
          16. endlocal&amp;set %1=%b%&amp;set %2=%Swap.a%&amp;goto :EOF</span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>This method has several drawbacks. Firstly, you must never use a period 
        in any variable name outside of your functions. Secondly, if the function 
        doesn't have a really short name and reads a number of variables by reference, 
        the number of lines of code in the function can double if you want to 
        avoid 'long' lines of code.</p>
      <p>An alternative method is to read the variables with the FOR /F command 
        using a delimiter character not present in any of the argument values. 
        Using this method the Swap function could be rewritten as follows:-</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="batch">12. :Swap<br>
          13. setlocal ENABLEEXTENSIONS<br>
          14. for /f &quot;tokens=1-2 delims=&not;&quot; %%a in ('echo/%%%1%%&not;%%%2%%') 
          do (<br>
          15. &nbsp;&nbsp;set a=%%a&amp;set b=%%b<br>
          16. )<br>
          17. endlocal&amp;set %1=%b%&amp;set %2=%a%&amp;goto :EOF</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The delimiter character is a '&not;' (ASCII 172, which looks like a back-to-front 
        'L' on its side). It was chosen because it's rarely used and it appears 
        on a UK keyboard (above the TAB key). If you don't have this key, you 
        can type it by holding down the Alt key and typing 172 on the numeric 
        keypad. The only drawback of this method being your variables must never 
        contain the delimiter character otherwise you may obtain incorrect results.</p>
