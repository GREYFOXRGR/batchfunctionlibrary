Later additions includes file, network and system functions. The library is no longer developed and is now archived on Github. Note, the webpages were designed for display in a treeview which itself was written in PHP/Javascript. The treeview code has largely been removed. Some of the internal hyperlinks might be broken, but you should have little trouble finding the target page. Happy batching!\r\n\r\n## Usage<a name=\"usage\"></a>\r\n\r\nDownload and extract the archive, open the page of interest in a browser.
